appCore
=======

If you want to use Backbone and AMD modules to build a large application, this core might be a good starting place for you.

It provides a way to abstract application-wide functionality like error management, page changing, and application paths up to a high level, and leave "pages" to control all of their content independently.

Leverages these included dependencies:
* Backbone / Underscore
* Curl.js
* Zepto

The app starts at:

    app1/index.html
